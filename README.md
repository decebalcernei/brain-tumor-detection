# Brain Tumor Detection
A detector based on CNN to classify brain MRIs for tumor presence and comparison of its performance against existing models, both in zero-shot mode and with fine-tuning. The project involved dataset cleaning,
augmentation, and preprocessing, with the ultimate goal of accurately predicting whether an MRI scan contains a tumor.
